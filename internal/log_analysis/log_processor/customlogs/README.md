# Custom log types

## Examples

#### Simple JSON object

##### Log sample

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/-/metrics",
  "format": "html",
  "controller": "MetricsController",
  "action": "index",
  "status": 200,
  "params": [],
  "remote_ip": "1.1.1.1",
  "user_id": null,
  "username": null,
  "ua": null,
  "queue_duration_s": null,
  "correlation_id": "c01ce2c1-d9e3-4e69-bfa3-b27e50af0268",
  "cpu_s": 0.05,
  "db_duration_s": 0,
  "view_duration_s": 0.00039,
  "duration_s": 0.0459,
  "tag": "test",
  "time": "2019-11-14T13:12:46.156Z"
}
```

##### Log schema definition

```YAML
schema: SampleAPI
fields:
- name: time
  description: Event timestamp
  required: true
  type: timestamp
  timeFormat: rfc3339
  isEventTime: true
- name: method
  description: The HTTP method used for the request
  type: string
- name: path
  description: The path used for the request
  type: string
- name: remote_ip
  description: The remote IP address the request was made from
  type: string
  indicator: ip
- name: duration_s
  description: The number of seconds the request took to complete
  type: float
- name: format
  description: Response format
  type: string
- name: user_id
  description: The id of the user that made the request
  type: string
- name: params
  type: array
  element:
    type: object
    fields:
    - name: key
      description: The name of a Query parameter
      type: string
    - name: value
      description: The value of a Query parameter
      type: string
- name: tag
  description: Tag for the request
  type: string
- name: ua
  description: UserAgent header
  type: string
```

##### Resulting panther log event

```json5
{
  duration_s: 0.0459,
  method: 'GET',
  p_any_ip_addresses: ['1.1.1.1'],
  p_event_timestamp: '2019-11-14 13:12:46.156000000',
  p_log_type: 'Custom.API',
  p_parse_timestamp: '2020-06-19 12:20:46.034959848',
  p_row_id: '507b9da5c6abad92adcae2ac0301',
  path: '/-/metrics',
  remote_ip: '1.1.1.1',
  timestamp: '2019-11-14 13:12:46.156000000',
  // ...
}
```

#### Notes

- The `time` field is used as the event timestamp and uses a 'built-in' timestamp format.
- The `remote_ip` field is marked as an `ip` indicator and is included in the result's `p_any_ip_addresses` field
- Only the defined fields are included in the output JSON

## Schema definition

### LogSchema

```YAML
schema: String # The name of the schema
version: 0 # optional field reserved for backwards compatibility in future versions
definitions: Map<string,ValueSchema> # optional index of named ValueSchema definitions to use with `ref`
fields: FieldSchema[] # A required non-empty array of FieldSchema
```

### FieldSchema

```YAML
name: String # required
required: Boolean
description: String
# includes all of the ValueSchema fields
```

### ValueSchema

`ValueSchema` describes a value in a JSON object. It's fields vary depending on `type`

```YAML
# ValueSchema fields
type: String # required (object|array|string|timestamp|int|smallint|bigint|boolean|float|ref)

# ObjectSchema fields (when type = object)
fields: FieldSchema[] # a non-empty array of FieldSchema

# ArraySchema fields (when type = array)
element: {} # ValueSchema of each array element (required when type = array)

# StringSchema fields (when type = string)
indicator: String # The indicator scanner to use for this string

# TimeSchema fields (when type = timestamp)
timeFormat: String # rfc3339|unix|unix_ms|unix_us|unix_ns
customTimeFormat: String  # a custom time format to use in strftime notation
isEventTime: Boolean # use this timestamp as the event time

# RefSchema fields (when type = ref)
ref: String # the name of a ValueSchema in the `definitions`
```

### AWS.CloudTrailInsight

This event schema has nested objects and some of them are duplicated. Using the YAML doc separator and `RefSpec` values,
we can avoid schema duplication and deep YAML hierarchies.

```YAML
schema: CloudTrailInsight
fields:
- name: eventVersion
  required: true
  type: string
  description: The version of the log event format.
